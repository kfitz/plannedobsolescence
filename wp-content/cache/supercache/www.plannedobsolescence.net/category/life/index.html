For me, a whole lot of stuff has long fallen into that category, and particularly things that have to do with taking care of myself. I ought to eat a little better. I ought to drop that five pounds. I ought to get more sleep. I ought to exercise more regularly. I know all of those statements are true, and I really do try to do the things they urge, but it’s often easier to let those things drop when competing demands arise.</p>
<p>And honestly, when don’t competing demands arise.</p>
<p>But I’m finding myself squarely in front of one of those moments when the world sends a no-kidding message: That “ought to”? You should maybe interpret as “must.”</p>
<p>Last week, right near the end of the DH conference, I started getting some pain in my left shoulder. I’ve got some kind recurrent tendonitis in both my shoulders, and with all the hauling of suitcases and carrying around of laptops, I figured I’d triggered it, which promised an aggravating few days ahead.</p>
<p>A week later, however, things had not gotten better. In fact, they were much worse: the pain was no longer localized in my shoulder, but was radiating both up my neck and down my arm. My small stash of Aleve was running out fast, and weirdly, given the range of things you can buy OTC here in Paris, naproxen is unavailable without a prescription. So R. talked me into seeing a doctor, and got a friend to make an appointment for me.</p>
<p>My experience of the French medical system is not the point of this post, but I should note how good it was: I got an appointment with a very good doctor for the very next day. She discussed the problem with me, did an examination, explained her diagnosis, and wrote me three prescriptions. The cost of the examination, for someone who was for all intents and purposes uninsured, was 50 euros. The cost of the three prescriptions, 15 euros. The doctor also said I should go get an x-ray, which I’m going to do while I’m here, both because I’m here for another three weeks and because it’ll be cheaper to pay out-of-pocket for it here than it will be to handle it through my insurance back home.<sup class='footnote'><a href='http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/must/#fn-2659-1' id='fnref-2659-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2659)'>1</a></sup></p>
<p>What I need the x-ray <em>for</em> is more to the point of the post: the doctor diagnosed me with a pinched nerve in my neck, almost certainly produced by <em>une arthrose</em> — cervical osteoarthritis.<sup class='footnote'><a href='http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/must/#fn-2659-2' id='fnref-2659-2' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2659)'>2</a></sup></p>
<p>My first response to this was annoyance. I am <em>way</em> too freaking young to have arthritis in my neck.</p>
<p>My second response was something much more akin to terror: if it feels like this in my mid-forties, what will it feel like in my sixties? My eighties?<sup class='footnote'><a href='http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/must/#fn-2659-3' id='fnref-2659-3' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2659)'>3</a></sup></p>
<p>And following fairly quickly on the heels of that was a fairly predictable conviction: I <em>have got</em> to start taking better care of myself.</p>
<p>What this means, however, is turning all those ought tos into musts. In particular, I must make more time for more regular exercise, to become as strong as I can in preparation for whatever the coming years are going to bring my way. And this is going to require two things of me:</p>
<p>First, I must reprioritize. It’s useless to say “I have to get more exercise” when my calendar and my to-do list simply cannot take more being crammed in. Something, in other words, must go — and it can no longer be the things that have always seemed too (literally) self-centered. What that something will be, I’m not entirely sure — but I am starting to recognize that where ambition or accomplishment gets in the way of basic physical health and well-being, maybe it deserves a little more critical examination.<sup class='footnote'><a href='http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/must/#fn-2659-4' id='fnref-2659-4' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2659)'>4</a></sup></p>
<p>And second, I need some kind of accountability, a means of ensuring that I actually follow through on what could turn out to be no more than a whole lot of good intentions, particularly once the pain fully recedes. So I’m hoping that maybe my internet friends will help hold me to these changes, and maybe even come along for the ride. If you use Runkeeper, I’m <a href="http://runkeeper.com/user/kfitz/">kfitz</a> there. I’ll try to post some here about how I’m doing as well.</p>
<p>I’m determined to be that wiry little old lady still running in the park when I’m 80. And I’m weirdly grateful, I think, for this last week-plus, which has made abundantly clear that that absolutely is not going to happen without some really determined decision-making on my part.</p>

Heart rate monitor obtained, and now used for two days. The resulting info was highly instructive, and I&#8217;m feeling pretty motivated, which is a decided improvement.</p>

And the ability to stand being outside for more than ten minutes at a time has me pondering the things that sustained me through this miserable winter. </p>
<p>In a word: Pork, and lots of it.</p>
<p>One of the best things I did this winter was develop a variation on the famous <a href="http://chronicle.com/blogs/profhacker/whats-for-lunch-the-versatility-of-pulled-pork/22720">ProfHacker pulled pork recipe</a>, engineered away from barbecue and towards carnitas. In the spirit of the commons, I now want to pass this on for further experimentation and remix.</p>
<p>One note of not-exactly caution: I invariably pretty much eyeball the spices, so the rub is totally much a YMMV thing. That said, I have yet to have this turn out anything less than awesome.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>Ingredients:</p>
<p>2 large or 3 medium yellow onions<br />
6ish cloves minced/crushed garlic<br />
coarse kosher salt<br />
Morton &#038; Bassett Mexican Blend spice mix<br />
oregano<br />
paprika<br />
olive oil<br />
5ish-lbs bone-in pork shoulder or pork shanks<br />
2 fresh jalapenos<br />
1 tub hot salsa (of the pico de gallo sort, usually found in the produce section)<br />
1/2 cup chicken stock</p>
<p>Very coarsely chop the onions and cover the bottom of a large-size slow cooker with them. Mix the garlic, salt, spice mix, oregano, paprika, and olive oil, which together should form a nice thick rust-colored paste.</p>
<p>Wash the pork and pat dry. Rub it thoroughly on all sides with the spice mix, and place on top of the onions. (If you use a pork shoulder, place it fat side up.)</p>
<p>Clean and chop the jalapenos, and scatter them on top of the pork roast. Pour the tub of hot salsa over the roast, and then add the chicken stock.</p>
<p>Turn the slow cooker on low, and&#8230; let it do its thing, for something on the order of 10 hours. I sometimes start this early in the morning, so that it&#8217;s ready for dinner. But even more often I start it after dinner and let it cook overnight. (The house fills with the smell of amazingly good pork, which produces really interesting dreams.) </p>
<p>In any case, the roast should be utterly falling apart by the time it&#8217;s done. Pull it out of the slow cooker a chunk at a time, cleaning away the fat and shredding the meat. </p>
<p>Because we tend to use the meat over the course of several days in things like tacos (soft corn tortillas, cheese, good salsa and guacamole), I store the meat in a large container, adding a bit of the cooking liquid that the roast leaves behind to keep it moist. I also totally recommend straining the rest of the cooking liquid (and removing the thick layer of fat from it), which leaves behind a super-rich gelatinous broth excellent for doing things like cooking greens.</p>
<p>And that&#8217;s how I made it through the winter. That and a series of chicken roasting experiments. But that&#8217;s another post entirely.</p>

<p>I hunted through the cabinets where I’ve stored the old family photos to find this one this morning. It’s probably my favorite Christmas picture.</p>
<p>There are so many things about this picture that I’m haunted by, my mother chief among them. She’s barely 23 here — quite mature, by the standards of the time, to have had her first baby, and yet I can never see this picture without focusing on how unbelievably <em>young</em> she is. I want so badly to reach back through the image and help.</p>
<p>I also can’t help but focus on how tired she looks: I’m about to be four months old, and it looks like it’s been a pretty eventful four months. Her wrists are so delicate, and her skin is so pale. And yet for all that superficial fragility, she would hold everything together a few years down the road, when it all must have seemed like it was falling apart.</p>
<p>Youth aside, exhaustion aside, in this picture is my most intense connection to my mother. But for a slightly different nose, the girl holding the baby could perfectly well be me. My life, just starting in this picture, could have circled around to this point with no effort at all.</p>
<p>So much of the path I’ve taken — that she helped me take — has been different, and yet it all for me starts here, in the open-mouthed wonder of it all. How <em>did</em> they get this thing in here? And what for?</p>
<p>Merry Christmas, and happy holidays.</p>

<p>If that sentence is an exaggeration, it&#8217;s not by much. A few friends who had the dubious pleasure of talking with me just after I arrived at THATCamp Leadership last week can attest that I showed up with an attitude that was in need of a little adjustment. Whenever I was asked how I was, I&#8217;d find myself starting out by saying &#8220;things are great,&#8221; which I meant, but which gradually gave way to a Five-Minute Complaint. I kept trying to stop myself, but it kept bubbling over. I&#8217;d hit some kind of limit, and my self-censor was just <em>gone</em>.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t that I was unhappy about being where I was; I was very pleased to be back at George Mason, to be seeing my friends, to be participating in an event that promised to be both important and energizing.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t that I was unhappy about where I&#8217;d just come from; I&#8217;d had an excellent, if action-packed, visit to talk with faculty and administrators at an institution thinking seriously about its digital initiatives in the humanities.</p>
<p>It was more that where I was and where I&#8217;d just come from were on the tail end of five solid weeks of travel and committee meetings, involving eight cities (not counting New York) and more planes, trains, and automobiles (and one unexpected <a href="https://twitter.com/kfitz/status/378637568671510528">van</a>) than I can count.</p>
<p>It was thirteen nights in eight hotels over a five-week period, capped off with a musty room with two double beds (rather than one king) on a low floor (rather than a high one) with an industrial rooftop right outside my window (rather than pretty much any other view possible from that building).</p>
<p>Something about that room was the last straw, the thing that sent me right over the edge into a bitter litany of complaint aimed at anyone who would listen. But it wasn&#8217;t the room, and it wasn&#8217;t the trip: it was everything I&#8217;d gotten myself into over the previous month and a half, and &#8212; especially &#8212; knowing full well that I&#8217;d done it to myself. That no one was responsible for where I was, or for the mood I was in, except me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve spent the week-plus since trying to how to rectify this situation, how to pull myself back from the edge of complete flaming disaster. (<sup class='footnote'><a href='http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/engage-disengage-repeat/#fn-2567-1' id='fnref-2567-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2567)'>1</a></sup>) Because, of course, my major projects did not grind to a halt in the office while I was traveling. Nor did the deadlines for the writing I&#8217;ve promised people this fall get any further away. It has become painfully clear that something has got to give &#8212; or that something will be me. And so, after a lot of thought, I think I&#8217;ve figured out what I need to do in order to make things better.</p>
<p>Less.</p>
<p>I need to do less.</p>
<p>* * * </p>
<p>You would be fully justified in rolling your eyes at this point. Because, yeah, duh. But this is a lesson that I have had to teach myself over and over.</p>
<p>I can read about <a href="http://www.salon.com/2013/10/16/your_brain_needs_more_downtime_than_it_thinks_partner/">the importance of significant downtime</a> and totally get it. I can even go so far as to write about the degree to which <a href="http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/blog/outward-and-visible-signs/">stress has become the contemporary sign of our salvation</a> or about the role of <a href="http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/blog/productivity-and-goofing-off/">goofing off</a> in the most important, most creative work that I do.</p>
<p>But I somehow cannot internalize it all enough to refrain from over-scheduling myself. Or at least I have not done so. And even when I think I&#8217;ve done a good job of protecting myself, of determining what&#8217;s <a href="http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/blog/enough/">enough</a> and trying not to go beyond it, I manage to cram enough tiny things in around the edges that I end up just as over-scheduled and exhausted as ever.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>If I&#8217;m going to be completely honest with myself &#8212; and this is hard &#8212; a huge percentage of this over-scheduling is about ego. People like my work enough to want me to come talk to them, and they&#8217;re nice to me when I get there, and that feels awfully, awfully good. (<sup class='footnote'><a href='http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/engage-disengage-repeat/#fn-2567-2' id='fnref-2567-2' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2567)'>2</a></sup>) There&#8217;s of course also a general people-pleasing aspect to the difficulties I have turning down requests. And as long as I&#8217;m at it I&#8217;ll acknowledge that I&#8217;ve also fallen under the spell of competitive busyness; every time somebody says &#8220;I don&#8217;t know how you do it&#8221; about my travel schedule I get a sad little boost.</p>
<p>Ha, I don&#8217;t know how I do it either.</p>
<p>I feel as though I&#8217;ve been able to do some good out there in my travels &#8212; as though I&#8217;ve been able to help some departments and institutions jumpstart some much-needed conversations, and as though I&#8217;ve been able to help demonstrate some of the possibilities for the academy&#8217;s future. But I also know, when I&#8217;m willing to look at it squarely, that I&#8217;ve gotten a lot out of just <em>feeling important</em>. But that&#8217;s finally wearing thin, and the toll is beginning to make itself known.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>It&#8217;s perhaps not a coincidence that during this same period I&#8217;ve found myself withdrawing from the various venues where I engage with colleagues and other folks online. I haven&#8217;t been very present on Twitter, and I certainly haven&#8217;t posted here. Some of that withdrawal has been about not having enough time or space or whatever to devote to figuring out whether I had anything worth saying. Some of it has been about a level of conflict of late that I haven&#8217;t had the energy to face. </p>
<p>In any case, for someone whose job is focused on fostering productive online engagements, this withdrawal has not seemed to me a Good Sign, and it&#8217;s been one more thing that&#8217;s had me worried.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m now thinking that the withdrawal is in part about the conservation of energy, and as such may not have been such a bad thing after all. Total disengagement would be a problem. But disengaging enough to restore oneself, in order to be better prepared to re-engage, is utterly, utterly necessary.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like sleep. It&#8217;s cyclical. And you&#8217;ll go crazy without it.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been reading a fair bit of self-help type stuff of late, partially (<sup class='footnote'><a href='http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/engage-disengage-repeat/#fn-2567-3' id='fnref-2567-3' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2567)'>3</a></sup>) because I&#8217;m interested in the genre, in how it can describe and shape lived experience, and in the purposes it might serve in a scholarly context, and in part because I have felt myself in need of something that might help me personally figure out a better path. A more manageable way of being in the world.</p>
<p>Among the things I&#8217;ve read lately is Jim Loehr and Tony Schwartz&#8217;s <a href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0743226755/ref=as_li_ss_tl?ie=UTF8&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=390957&#038;creativeASIN=0743226755&#038;linkCode=as2&#038;tag=plannedobsole-20"><em>The Power of Full Engagement</em></a>, which, if they&#8217;ll forgive me, is a rotten title for a very important book. (<sup class='footnote'><a href='http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/engage-disengage-repeat/#fn-2567-4' id='fnref-2567-4' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2567)'>4</a></sup>) The key lesson in the book &#8212; heck, it&#8217;s in the subtitle, but if you&#8217;re interested, read farther than that &#8212; is that our belief that the resource we are shortest on, the thing that if only we had more of we could do what we need to do, is time, is dead wrong. In fact, the resource we are shortest on is energy, and we resist many of the things we need to do in order to conserve and restore our energy because they look to us like enormous wastes of time.</p>
<p>However, it&#8217;s clear that those wastes of time are precisely the things that allow us to step out of the barrage of the urgent long enough to discover, focus on, and <a href="http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/blog/making-room/">make room for the important</a>. In order to be genuinely engaged where it most matters, in other words, you have to find regular, routine ways to disengage. And to somebody as completely inculcated into our always-on, more more more culture as I am, that disengagement does not come easily.</p>
<p>Or at least it doesn&#8217;t come easily in a productive form. But it&#8217;s becoming clear that if I don&#8217;t figure out some better strategies for managing productive disengagement, a few much more damaging modes of disengagement are lurking just around the corner.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>So, doing less. It&#8217;s not just a matter of saying no to more things. I keep trying to find some quantitative limit for how much I can do &#8212; no more than one trip every two weeks! no more than three major service commitments! &#8212; and yet it keeps not working. The over-extendedness just gets worse.</p>
<p>I finally realized something about why last week. In talking with my coach (<sup class='footnote'><a href='http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/engage-disengage-repeat/#fn-2567-5' id='fnref-2567-5' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2567)'>5</a></sup>) about the issue, it suddenly became clear that the problem is the nature of the <em>quantitative</em> itself. If I set a limit of four trips per semester, it becomes very hard to distinguish between four trips and four with one little add-on. Or five, for that matter. With maybe one small side thing tucked in there too. And something local, because that&#8217;s not really a trip. And next thing you know, I have a calendar filled with five solid weeks of three-city trips and am railing at my friends over cocktails.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the nature of the more more more culture: if you can run two miles, isn&#8217;t it better to run five? If you can write an article about something, isn&#8217;t it better to turn it into a book? If you can speak in four places this semester, isn&#8217;t it better to add on just… one… more…?</p>
<p>The quantitative will do you in every time, precisely because so much of how we operate is all about finding our limits and pushing past them. So it&#8217;s becoming clear to me that I&#8217;ve got to turn my attention to the qualitative, if I&#8217;m going to change anything, even if it&#8217;s not entirely clear what in this context the qualitative might mean.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>One key to the qualitative, I think, is figuring out how to determine what&#8217;s important, and how to separate it from what&#8217;s just nice, or ego-gratifying, or adding to the frequent-flyer record. But the real challenge in that is that I don&#8217;t mean &#8220;important&#8221; in some externally-defined sense: what&#8217;s best going to further my career goals, or promote my organization, or what have you. I mean what is most important in a very personal sense: what&#8217;s most in line with the things I value, the things I want to be, the ways I want to live. What&#8217;s going to support me not just in getting more done, but in doing what I most want to do, and doing it better.</p>
<p>What am I doing it all <em>for</em>, is the question I keep asking myself.</p>
<p>* * *</p>
<p>As I&#8217;ve been working on this post, I&#8217;ve been hoping that some conclusion would present itself to me, some anecdote that would cheerily illustrate everything I&#8217;m pondering here. I&#8217;m not sure that anything can; I&#8217;m not sure that concluding, in fact, is the right way to end this line of thought. As the links above might suggest, I&#8217;ve written too many times before about the need to recalibrate and reshape the way I&#8217;m living, and yet. Here I am. Again.</p>
<p>I had, however, a near-perfect day yesterday. I did a bit of work in the morning, and then went and got a fantastic haircut, and had a great lunch with a friend I haven&#8217;t seen in eons, and then headed back home. And on a whim, I told R. that I wanted to take a walk in the park. Rather than push it, though, in the ways that I usually do (<em>surely you can go a little faster!</em>), I let myself just… walk. A bit faster than a stroll. Kind of an amble. It only took about five minutes longer than usual to make the loop of the park, and in the process, I got to do two really important things. I got to spend the hour really talking with R., and I got to look around.</p>
<p>And the trees. If it&#8217;s not peak leaf around here yet, at least a few of the trees are there: flaming reds and yellows mixed in amongst the still-rich greens. It was absolutely gorgeous, the best moment of my favorite season.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s uncomfortably obvious (see footnote 5 above) to point out that it will all be gone in the blink of an eye. But it will be. And I&#8217;m grateful, really really grateful, not to have missed it.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what I&#8217;m doing it for. That&#8217;s what I want to keep my eye on. How the things I elect to do can better contribute to my ability to engage with the here and now, and, when I need to recover, can let me gently disengage.</p>
<p>I do not know how. But I do know why. And that&#8217;s at least a start.</p>

As week four begins today, and as I see this trip beginning to draw to a close, I&#8217;ve been reflecting a bit on how it all went, and how to carry some of this feeling with me back home.</p>
<p>When folks have asked me lately how my vacation has been, my instinct has been to say &#8220;great! It&#8217;s been <em>super</em> productive!&#8221; Which causes people to blink, or shake their heads, or otherwise give me the <em>you&#8217;re doing it wrong</em> look.</p>
<p>Perhaps it&#8217;s true that I&#8217;m doing it wrong. I&#8217;ve never been terribly good, though, at doing the things one is supposed to do on vacation or on a trip to a new place. I&#8217;m not a sight-seer. I don&#8217;t feel compelled to visit the national landmarks and museums. I do, however, like to sit still, to let myself really be where I am, and to let my brain wander where it will. Where it will wander, when given the chance, is often to reading, or writing, to new projects or new directions for in-process projects.</p>
<p>For this reason, for me, the &#8220;working vacation&#8221; is not a contradiction in terms, not a capitulation to the always-on logic of the new economy. It&#8217;s one of the best ways for me to retreat from the busyness &#8212; or the business &#8212; of the day-to-day and focus on the things that matter to me, whatever they might be.</p>
<p>My time in Prague has been a working vacation in a most literal sense: most of my time has been charged as vacation, but some of it has been charged as remote working. I&#8217;ve kept up with a much-streamlined version of the things going on in my office, I&#8217;ve handled some small much-delayed tasks, and I&#8217;ve used the rest of my remote working time to focus in on one large day-job project of the sort that I would never have been able to get to during the normal 9-to-5, a substantive chunk of writing that required distance just to get space on my agenda.</p>
<p>The rest of my time has been spent on my own projects. I&#8217;ve drafted an essay, I&#8217;ve begun sketching out another one, and I&#8217;ve read a lot. And for the first time in eons, I&#8217;ve found that reading scholarship has been just as much <em>fun</em> as reading fiction.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve had fantastic meals, and I&#8217;ve slept a ton, and I&#8217;ve spent time hanging out with friends and watching television series that I missed. But being able to be just selfish enough about my time to restart my reading brain again has been really exciting. That self-directedness has made this time both enormously restorative and enormously productive &#8212; and perhaps productive precisely because it was so restorative, and restorative precisely because it was so productive.</p>
<p>In a week, I&#8217;ll be returning to the more socially-oriented aspects of my job, and I&#8217;ll undoubtedly discover just how much of the usual business my colleagues kept out of my inbox while I was gone. I&#8217;m grateful to them for that, and to my boss for the willingness to negotiate this working vacation with me. I&#8217;m looking forward to returning to the office with renewed energy &#8212; and hoping to find ways to maintain the space for creative thought that I&#8217;ve had the luxury of rediscovering this month. </p>

<p>Like last summer, I&#8217;m on the road for quite a while, starting with a spate of bouncing from conference to conference and concluding with a nice long period of being still in Prague. Unlike last summer, however, I am staying in Europe for the entirety of the trip, and not bouncing back to the US until it&#8217;s over.</p>
<p>Sadly, this means that I&#8217;m missing several US events that I&#8217;d like to be at &#8212; most notably <a href="http://www.aaupnet.org/events-a-conferences/annual-meeting/aaup-2013">AAUP</a> and <a href="http://dh2013.unl.edu/">DH</a> &#8212; but the physical toll that my mid-tour return stateside took on me last year was way too high.</p>
<p>So this year&#8217;s schedule is a good bit <a href="http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/blog/itinerary/">less insane than last</a>, and I expect it to be terrific fun:</p>
<ul>
<li>18-22 June &#8212; Geneva, Switzerland; <a href="http://indico.cern.ch/conferenceDisplay.py?confId=211600">OAI 8</a></li>
<li>22-30 June &#8212; Göttingen, Germany; <a href="http://www.uni-goettingen.de/de/419609.html">Cultures of Obsolescence</a></li>
<li>30 June &#8211; 3 July &#8212; London, England; <a href="http://www.jisc-collections.ac.uk/JISC-Collections-events/oabooksconf/">JISC/OAPEN conference on Open Access Monographs</a>.</li>
<li>3-31 July &#8212; Prague, Czech Republic; utterly, totally event-free.</li>
</ul>
<p>And so far, so good, on all fronts; I arrived in Geneva this morning, hopped a fairly easy bus transfer to my hotel, had some breakfast and struggled to stay awake until my room became available, and then crashed for several hours. This afternoon, got a bit of work done. Tonight, an early dinner, a good night&#8217;s sleep (<em>please please please</em>), and on to OAI 8 tomorrow.</p>

I came to it late; I hated running as a kid, and I avoided it as much as I could in high school. And given that on the one hand I was pretty notably underweight until my mid-20s, and on the other, I grew up in a time and place that hadn&#8217;t yet been touched by things like girls&#8217; soccer teams, nobody really forced me to think about anything like exercise. I joined a gym here and there; I took the occasional aerobics class. Never anything with any focus.</p>
<p>Until I went back to grad school. For some reason, that first semester at NYU I got serious. I went to Coles (which I recall being pretty shiny and new then) and took a prescriptive fitness class, where I learned a few basic things about exercise and was supervised through a range of circuit training programs. I remember spending a lot of my cardio time on a stair climber, until one of the instructors stopped me one day and said &#8220;mix it up a bit, Kathleen!&#8221; So I got on a treadmill and ran a mile in 10 minutes &#8212; the first mile I had ever run in my life. I was 26.</p>
<p>And I was hooked. R. and I started running together whenever we could. I was way slower than he was, always, but he pulled me along and got me to do more than I thought I could. And I ran by myself, too: endless tight little laps on Coles&#8217;s roof track, at first, and then once I moved to Hell&#8217;s Kitchen, early morning loops of lower Central Park. Those years, I was probably in the best physical shape of my life, and it was clear that the running was helping keep me on an even keel through the craziness of grad school.</p>
<p>But, being a grad student, I let the running gradually come, like everything else to be about Accomplishment. There&#8217;s nothing wrong with that, at least in the abstract, but it did something to the experience for me. It drove me to do more and more, well past the point at which I really should have just let myself settle into a more meditative routine.</p>
<p>In 1997, as I went on the job market, moved into high gear trying to finish my dissertation, and took on a full-time load of freelance work, my number came up in the lottery for the NYC marathon. And so I added training for that race to my schedule.</p>
<p>The marathon itself was amazing, though I ran it about half an hour slower than I&#8217;d hoped (partly for reasons out of my control; partly because of some less than optimal choices I made). It was an astonishing day, though, and I have no regrets whatsoever about the marathon itself. <em>Training</em> for the marathon, however, was another story. For months, I got up well before dawn to go run before settling down to work. I gave up hours and hours during the week, and pretty much a full day on the weekend, to running. And everything hurt pretty much all the time &#8212; not from an injury, just that overstressed, overused, constant ache.</p>
<p>I recovered slowly after the race, and gradually got back to a more normal level of running. Sort of. Something about all of those hours made me kind of dread running, and so once I graduated and moved to Claremont and started the business of being an assistant professor, I gradually… just… stopped.</p>
<p>Which is when the running dreams started, I think. I&#8217;d have these incredible dreams about running very strange race courses &#8212; across cities, in buildings, down stairs, through stores. Or I&#8217;d start running to try to catch someone, and just keep going. In my dreams, I was <em>fast</em>, and I felt great. A little nudge from the unconscious, I think, saying &#8220;don&#8217;t you want to feel this again when you&#8217;re awake?&#8221;</p>
<p>So I did gradually pick the running back up again, but wound up following the same cycle: ran well and felt great; ran more and felt better; decided to see if I could run another marathon. That one was Los Angeles, in 2005, and again the race itself <a href="http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/blog/how-it-went/">went super well</a>. And again, all the running before and after, a bit less so. I blew out one of my arches due to all the overtraining, and wound up with orthotics, which I never really got the hang of running with. And gradually, again, I stopped.</p>
<p>I picked the running back up a bit during my sabbatical a couple of years ago, but things started hurting again, and so I backed back off, trying to find my way to something that would be <a href="http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/blog/enough/">enough</a>. Since then I&#8217;ve done some yoga, and a bunch of walking, but nothing has felt quite as good as running at its best has felt. And if I actually get to move into the apartment that I&#8217;m hoping I&#8217;ll be moving into soon, I&#8217;m going to have amazing access to another amazing park, and I want to be able to take advantage of that.</p>
<p>So I&#8217;m back at it, running again. And I&#8217;m trying to get myself to think about &#8220;enough&#8221; on the front end, as I&#8217;m starting up, rather than when things begin breaking down. I&#8217;m nearly 20 years older than I was when I ran that first mile, and I weigh a fair bit more, and things just don&#8217;t work quite like they used to. I eased my way into running this time with a lot of walking, and then slow short running intervals, gradually increasing them until I could run continuously. I&#8217;m a couple of months in, and it all feels pretty decent &#8212; nothing hurts, and I&#8217;m recovering from my runs well.</p>
<p>But I&#8217;m <em>slow</em>. What used to be my steady training pace is now my all-out intervals pace. I can feel my younger selves sneering at what my steady training pace has now become.</p>
<p>I remember telling R. years ago, in those early running days, that the key aspect of discipline for me was less about the need to make myself go do something than it was about the need to keep myself from doing too much. And so I&#8217;m trying to be very disciplined about things, to build strength slowly, to keep plodding forward, to focus on the years ahead rather than the miles right now.</p>

I&#8217;ve got an enormous deadline just ahead &#8212; not, alas, the &#8220;boy, I&#8217;m going to blow that deadline and then I&#8217;m going to feel sheepish and guilty when I finally send the thing in two weeks late&#8221; kind, but the &#8220;I will be standing in front of a very large crowd of people unveiling absolutely nothing if this thing doesn&#8217;t get done on time&#8221; kind. And in fact I think it&#8217;s going to get done on time, if we can keep all the little parts working like they&#8217;re supposed to. But this weekend a whole bunch of the little parts stopped working. Freaking out may have ensued. </p>
<p>My stress levels, it is needless to say, are through the roof right now. And so Sunday morning, I finally managed &#8212; after an altogether alarming number of weeks &#8212; to get myself out the door and to a yoga class. And the class was mostly great, and I&#8217;m very glad I went, but I had the thing happen afterward where the class managed &#8212; I don&#8217;t know how else to describe this &#8212; to open one of those spots in my body where I shove a whole lot of anxiety and anger and sadness that I don&#8217;t want to deal with, and so all of that got released and came flooding to the surface. Needless to say, this is more or less the exact opposite of what I want from yoga.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to leave myself open to the possibility, however, that it&#8217;s what I need, that exhuming all that negative stuff is a necessary precursor to developing the positive stuff I&#8217;m looking for. And so I tried to do the thing that I find so hard: to really let myself feel the anxiety and anger and sadness without either clinging to the feelings or pushing them away.</p>
<p>Saying that I find that hard is an understatement. For one thing, I have a thick streak of Pollyanna in me, one that fairly relentlessly shoves aside anything negative with a rousing internal chorus of &#8220;take off that gloomy mask of tragedy; it&#8217;s not your style&#8221; and other such anthems of indefatigable optimism.<sup class='footnote'><a href='http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/feeling-my-way-through/#fn-2403-1' id='fnref-2403-1' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2403)'>1</a></sup> For another, however, and probably more importantly, I have spent so long as a scholar living in brain-on-a-stick mode &#8212; pushing aside all of the claims not just of my body but of my heart as well, in favor of a total acquiescence to the dictates of my head &#8212; that I find it really, really hard to actually feel what I am feeling. As soon as I start feeling something, I want more than anything to <em>know</em> what I am feeling, to name it, determine its etiology, decide whether it&#8217;s beneficial, and if not, eradicate it as quickly as possible.</p>
<p>Actually living with a feeling long enough to feel it? Unthinkable. Which may precisely be the point.</p>
<p>There&#8217;s a deep irony in this, given that I was a most over-emotional adolescent &#8212; and that adolescence stretched on longer than I might care to admit. It&#8217;s possible that I was referred to as &#8220;histrionic&#8221; on more than one occasion, and certain very close family members may or may not have compared me to melodramatists of screen and stage. (Often.)</p>
<p>I learned from those family members, of course, not just about what was seemly and what wasn&#8217;t, but also what was valued and what wasn&#8217;t &#8212; and it turned out that the ability to contain your emotions, to condense them into a little knot that can take up residence between your shoulder blades, to push feeling aside in favor of thinking, was a useful skill, professionally speaking. And I discovered that the more I rationalized, the less frequently I was told I was irrational, over-emotional, highstrung. The more, in fact, I was told that I was smart. </p>
<p>I&#8217;m now at a crossroads, however, at which I am beginning to wonder whether there might be benefits &#8212; I mean, not just personal benefits, but real, actual, professional benefits, benefits for the profession and its relationship to the world &#8212; to ending the rational charade, to remember what it felt like to feel things, even to let feeling sometimes take the lead.<sup class='footnote'><a href='http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/feeling-my-way-through/#fn-2403-2' id='fnref-2403-2' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2403)'>2</a></sup> What would it be for academia to cultivate its relationship with its heart just as much as that with its head?<sup class='footnote'><a href='http://www.plannedobsolescence.net/feeling-my-way-through/#fn-2403-3' id='fnref-2403-3' onclick='return fdfootnote_show(2403)'>3</a></sup></p>
<p>Perhaps I&#8217;m over-generalizing what is in fact a personal, individual issue. But I don&#8217;t think so. I am coming to think that many aspects of academic life, from faculty meetings to hiring and promotion processes, including communication both amongst ourselves and with the outside world, would be much improved if we all stopped insisting that everything of value can be thought, if we focused on cultivating an emotional maturity to complement our intellectual maturity. If we weren&#8217;t too embarrassed to hit &#8220;publish&#8221; on a post that starts like this one, that&#8217;s so personal as to be all about how I <em>feel</em>.</p>

I&#8217;ve gotten out of the habit of writing every morning; I&#8217;ve gotten out of the habit of leaving work on time in order to make it to my yoga class. I&#8217;ve gotten out of the habit of eating well. I&#8217;ve gotten out of the habit of making slow but steady progress on a big project. And then there are the less than great habits that I&#8217;ve gotten myself in of late (which I won&#8217;t delve into here).</p>
<p>Part of the problem, I&#8217;m realizing this morning, is that the habits that I want to cultivate aren&#8217;t mobile friendly. They require a life in which one reliably wakes up at the same time, in the same place, pretty much every day, or at least for consistently long enough periods that changes can be managed and settled down into new routines. </p>
<p>But the life I&#8217;ve chosen isn&#8217;t at all consistent. It has periods of consistency that fool me into believing that I have established some good habits that can sustain me through whatever little disruptions I encounter. This, I am realizing today, is a fundamental miscalculation. My life is mobile at heart; if I go three weeks without traveling, it begins to feel a bit like a staycation, a long, luxurious lie-in at home. Every time I leave, every time things get somehow disrupted, I lose my hold on all of my good habits, and I have a miserably hard time picking them back up again.</p>
<p>What I need to develop is a set of habits that are as mobile as I am, habits that are disruption-tolerant. Can there be such a thing? I don&#8217;t mean habits that I can take on the road with me, necessarily, though that would be ideal; more, I&#8217;m after habits that can be slipped in and out of based on location. Location-based habits. <em>Hey, you&#8217;re home. How about a yoga class? Oh, wait, this looks like a hotel. How about taking a walk?</em></p>
<p>Exercise is the obvious example, and also the example with the most obvious fix: it&#8217;s available anywhere. It&#8217;s <em>about</em> mobility. But there are other habits that I keep trying to cultivate, habits that require stillness, that continue to slip away every time I travel, or every time my schedule shifts. Habits like writing. I have tried to find ways to accommodate my mobility &#8212; the first three-quarters or so of this post was written on my iPhone, while standing on the subway &#8212; but there&#8217;s an enormous difference between writing a blog post on the run and working on a longer project.</p>
<p>What I want, I think, is to cultivate a set of habits that can look at all of the things I want to do &#8212; the big projects, the exercise, the eating right, and so on &#8212; and find the writing-on-the-iPhone solution, the thing that will allow me to keep making progress even while I&#8217;m on the move.</p>
